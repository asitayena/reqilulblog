She became keenly interested in her mom's work from a young age.</p><p class=dh>Autumn was born just after her parents' secret wedding, having kept her gender a secret as well. She is the first of three children her parents share and is the only girl.</p><p class=dh>Her mother has spoken about her on many occasions during interviews and on social media, detailing her love for her and how much she is impressed with her mother's work. However, like the rest of her siblings, Autumn is kept away from the public eye.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Autumn James Hallisay's Gender Was Initially Kept a Secret</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>On November 26, 2013, Love Hewitt gave birth to a daughter Autumn James. A representative of the actress confirmed the birth of the new family member, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jennifer-love-hewitt-welcomes-daughter-autumn-james/>saying</a> Hallisay and Love Hewitt "are thrilled to announce the birth of their daughter Autumn James Hallisay."</p><p class=dh>The couple, who had secretly married a few days earlier, kept the gender of their first child a surprise throughout the pregnancy. They even had a gender-neutral baby shower a month before they welcomed their baby girl. Nevertheless, the actress had always wanted to be a mother as she had had an excellent relationship with hers.</p><p class=dh>In anticipation of becoming a mother, Love Hewitt told People she was ready to pass on to her child "all the great love" her mom had for her. She said this while explaining how her mother's death a year and a half earlier had a profound effect on her, even though it came at a later stage in life.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Autumn Grew up Being Fascinated by Her Mom's Hard Work</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Autumn has been lucky enough to see her mother in action and was impressed by what she saw on set. While shooting the television series "9-1-1," Love Hewitt was sometimes accompanied by her children, Autumn, and son, <a class="me a" href=#>Atticus James</a>, who she said enjoyed their time there. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/jennifer-love-hewitt-talks-separating-from-her-kids-on-9-1-1-set/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"My daughter thinks that work is the coolest thing she's ever seen. My son got to run around the lot (on the set)... which he thought was super cool."</p><p class=dh>Despite her young age, Autumn seemed to take a lot of interest in her mom's work. She is said to have started imitating some of the phrases used in the Ryan Murphy-created "9-1-1," <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-love-hewitt-says-her-4-year-old-daughter-is-already-imitating-her-9-1-1-role-exclusive>saying</a> things like "9-1-1, what's your problem?" which her mom thought was a little too much attitude during an emergency.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, she became interested in <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/parents/jennifer-love-hewitt-going-back-to-work-parenting-kids-911/>watching Garfield films</a> after someone from school mentioned it. They watched together, and Love Hewitt was warmed by her reaction when Autumn applauded her mom's performance after they had finished watching.</p><p class=dh>However, as much as Autumn enjoys her mother's work, she also reminds her mother that she needs <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/BkfUt_hF19O/>to slow down</a>. Love Hewitt said her daughter teaches her to remember what is truly important, creating deep love, joy, and safety for her children daily.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Autumn Is Now in Third Grade but Remains Out of the Spotlight</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Time seems to be moving fast for the Hallisay-Love Hewitt household, with the mother in disbelief that her children were growing so quickly. In August 2022, Autumn began her life as a third grader while her brothers were not too far behind. The mother of three <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/ChK1D7AppbW/>exclaimed</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We are ready for the new school year! Can’t wait to give these to the kids. Can’t believe I will have a 3rd grader, 1st grader and 1 year old in the same month! Life is beautiful."</p><p class=dh>Autumn spent a significant amount of time being <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jennifer-love-hewitt-jokes-she-needs-help-homeschooling-her-2-kids/>home-schooled</a> by her mother in her earlier grades due to the lockdown necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unfamiliar circumstances, Autumn continued to warm her mother's heart when she asked if Love Hewitt could come and teach at her school after the lockdown.</p><p class=dh>Furthermore, Autumn has shown an eye for art, as seen in an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B_dgLQagXer/>adorable art project</a> she made with her sibling and mother, <a class="me a" href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>. The visually pleasing creation was made using paint dots, cotton balls, and a poster board.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnam9jbXqiwdOupKdlmpa6pr%2BMoZilpJmorrp5yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6vnGaglay2b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html&text=Autumn%20James%20Hallisay%3a%20Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitts%20Daughter%20Loves%20Moms%20Job&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html&title=Autumn%20James%20Hallisay%3a%20Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitts%20Daughter%20Loves%20Moms%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html&title=Autumn%20James%20Hallisay%3a%20Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitts%20Daughter%20Loves%20Moms%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html&title=Autumn%20James%20Hallisay%3a%20Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitts%20Daughter%20Loves%20Moms%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f301738-autumn-james-hallisay-jennifer-love-hewi-html.html&description=Autumn%20James%20Hallisay%3a%20Jennifer%20Love%20Hewitts%20Daughter%20Loves%20Moms%20Job" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brooklyn-beckham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooklyn Beckham">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ajax-amsterdam-ac-milan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ajax Amsterdam - AC Milan, Oct 1, 2013 - UEFA Champions League - Match sheet">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
