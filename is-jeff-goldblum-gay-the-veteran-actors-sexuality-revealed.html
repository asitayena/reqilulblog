Many would not expect celebrities his age to be questioned about their sexuality but with fame comes rumors. So is Jeff Goldblum gay?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You might recognize Jeff Goldblum from classics such as “Threshold” or “Jurassic Park,” but have you ever wondered if the star is gay, bisexual, or straight? Here’s everything you need to satisfy your curiosity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Jeff_Goldblum></span>Who Is Jeff Goldblum?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum</a>, born October 22, 1952, in West Homestead, Pennsylvania, is an American actor and musician. His father, Leonard, was a physician and US Army major during the second world war. At the same time, his mother, Shirley, was a radio broadcaster who later ran a kitchen equipment and appliances sales firm.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jeff.jpg><p>At 17, Jeffery moved to New York City to become an actor. He worked on the stage and studied acting at the renowned Neighborhood Playhouse under the guidance of acting coach Sanford Meisner.&nbsp;</p><p>He made his Broadway debut in the musical “Two Gentlemen of Verona” in 1971 and his film debut as a home-invading thug in the 1974 film “Death Wish.” Goldblum also appeared in commercials for prominent brands like Toyota and lent his voice to numerous Apple commercials for their iMac and iBook during the 1990s.</p><p>The actor has been in some Hollywood blockbusters such as “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Jurassic Park,” and “Thor,” to name a few. In 2014, Goldblum reignited his musician side and made a jazz band called “The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra.”&nbsp;</p><p>The band gained some fame and did a weekly show at Carlyle Hotel. Billboard reported on May 29, 2018, that Decca Records asked Goldblum’s band to record a studio album for a later-year release, and the band subsequently released two more jazz albums over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>Goldblum was the subject of the 2021 biography “Because He’s Jeff Goldblum,” written by Washington Post writer Travis M. Andrews. Goldblum has bagged some industry’s most coveted awards and nominations and still acts today. His estimated net worth is around $40 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jeff_Goldblum_Gay></span>Is Jeff Goldblum Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Jeff Goldblum is not gay. He has been in several relationships with women, some of which have led to marriage. Despite the many rumors, no credible evidence suggests or proves he is gay.</p><p>Rumors regarding his sexuality made the rounds when a video of him circulated on the internet in September 2019. At a New Orleans LGBTQ+ summer party, observers witnessed the actor dancing to Normani’s “Motivation”</p><p>He wore a leopard print shirt and tiger print trousers, and some fans likened his outfit to what a gay man would wear. Goldblum has not said much in response to these rumors, but his three previous marriages to women are enough to speak for him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Times_Has_Jeff_Goldblum_Been_Married></span>How Many Times Has Jeff Goldblum Been Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The “Death Wish” star has entered into three marriages, with two of them being co-stars from some of his movies. Let’s take a look at his marital history.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Patricia_Gaul></span>Patricia Gaul<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Goldblum met fellow actor Patricia Gaul, with whom he worked on the set of the popular TV show “Silverado.” They entered matrimony in 1980 and remained together until their divorce in 1985. They did not have any kids together.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Geena_Davis></span>Geena Davis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Two years after his first divorce, Goldblum married co-star <a href=#>Geena Davis</a> in 1987. The two were featured in several movies together, including “Transylvania 6-5000” (1985), “The Fly” (1986), and “Earth Girls Are Easy” (1988).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/geena.jpg><p>In October 1990, Davis initiated the divorce proceedings, which concluded in 1991.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Emilie_Livingston></span>Emilie Livingston<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2014, Emilie Livingston, a Canadian athlete, and former Olympian, became the spouse of the “California Split” star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Emilie.jpg><p>Fans expressed discontent with their union due to the age difference of about thirty years between Goldblum and Emilie. They have two sons, Charlie and River.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Jeff_Goldblum_Currently_Married_To></span>Who Is Jeff Goldblum Currently Married To?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Goldblum is still married to Emilie Livingston. While he might be the most popular of the two, Livingston had long made a name for herself.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Emilie-and-jeff.jpg><p>Emilie Livingston was born on January 4, 1983. People often label her as ‘multi-talented’ due to her roles as a retired athlete, former Olympic gymnast, and actress specializing in body doubles. She subbed for <a href=#>Rihanna’s</a> character, Bubble Dancer, in 2017’s “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” and Emma Stone’s “La La Land” character, Mia, in 2016.</p><p>Jeff Goldblum might have had a very eventful love life before finding “the one,” but he is surely a heterosexual man. While curiosity is natural, it’s essential to approach the topic of celebrities’ sexuality with sensitivity and respect for individual privacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5yZ6dn2WXpLmlrsuupGafka56tbTEZq2erJWnrq95wJyrqKqjYsCmxNSao6KsqWK%2FpsLEmqOenF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html&text=Is%20Jeff%20Goldblum%20Gay%3f%20The%20Veteran%20Actors%20Sexuality%20Revealed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html&title=Is%20Jeff%20Goldblum%20Gay%3f%20The%20Veteran%20Actors%20Sexuality%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html&title=Is%20Jeff%20Goldblum%20Gay%3f%20The%20Veteran%20Actors%20Sexuality%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html&title=Is%20Jeff%20Goldblum%20Gay%3f%20The%20Veteran%20Actors%20Sexuality%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jeff-goldblum-gay-the-veteran-actors-sexuality-revealed.html&description=Is%20Jeff%20Goldblum%20Gay%3f%20The%20Veteran%20Actors%20Sexuality%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dame-dash-on-why-original-cast-wont-return-for-paid-in-full-2-they-too-old-itll-be-what-paid-in-full-nursing-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Itll Be What?
