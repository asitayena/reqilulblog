But recent legal setbacks for the artist might force him to finally reveal his true self. According to The National Post, Banksy has lost the rights to four of his works in recent rulings handed down by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.</p><p>The most recent ruling forced Banksy to relinquish his trademarks for two works: "Radar Rat" and "Girl with an Umbrella." Full Colour Black, a British greeting card company, argued in court that as works of graffiti in the public sphere, they have a legal right to reproduce Banksy's work in their products, an opinion that was agreed upon by the European Union Intellectual Property Office in their ruling on the matter:</p><p><strong>"It was free to be photographed by the general public and has been disseminated widely. Banksy permitted parties to disseminate his work and even provided high-resolution versions of his work on his website and invited the public to download them and produce their own items."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-321050 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-53335522.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-321050 class=wp-caption-text>Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images</p><p>Another factor in the ruling was said to be Banksy's anonymity. Since the artist's "identity cannot be legally determined," the ruling states that his anonymity effectively "hinders him from being able to protect this art under copyright laws without identifying himself." That means that if Banksy is serious about preventing other entities like Full Colour Black from re-appropriating his work, he might have to finally reveal his real name and identity in public.</p><p>Now, Banksy has to decide whether his anonymity is more important than his ability to control the ways his work might be used. If he decides to come out to protect his trademarks, it would be a significant change in his position on the subject. In "Wall and Piece," a book he wrote in 2006, Banksy stated that "copyright is for losers."</p><p>Losers perhaps, but extremely RICH losers.</p><p>In March 2021, a single Banksy piece called "Game Changer" sold at auction for $20 million. That topped his previous record of $12 million which someone paid in 2019 for a piece called "Devolved Parliament."</p><p>Imagine how much money could be generated by a line of authorized Banksy iPhone chargers, pillow cases, re-prints, post cards and more.</p><p>If you were Banksy, would you maintain your anonymity or go for the money?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnCuwKeirLFdoraotNNmn5qulWLBsHnRnq2emZxitaq%2FjKKbnqaknsG6ecinZKiqlJq%2FbsDOZq6ipl2XrqS3jJymp6yipLluu8Vmn6KrXam%2ForDEppiro6Nk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html&text=Banksy%20Might%20Have%20To%20Reveal%20His%20Identity%20In%20Order%20To%20Win%20Back%20Control%20Of%20His%20Trademarks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html&title=Banksy%20Might%20Have%20To%20Reveal%20His%20Identity%20In%20Order%20To%20Win%20Back%20Control%20Of%20His%20Trademarks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html&title=Banksy%20Might%20Have%20To%20Reveal%20His%20Identity%20In%20Order%20To%20Win%20Back%20Control%20Of%20His%20Trademarks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html&title=Banksy%20Might%20Have%20To%20Reveal%20His%20Identity%20In%20Order%20To%20Win%20Back%20Control%20Of%20His%20Trademarks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbanksy-might-have-to-reveal-his-identity-in-order-to-win-back-control-of-his-trademarks.html&description=Banksy%20Might%20Have%20To%20Reveal%20His%20Identity%20In%20Order%20To%20Win%20Back%20Control%20Of%20His%20Trademarks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brooke-sorenson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooke Sorenson Real Name, Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./angie-everhart-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angie Everhart Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
