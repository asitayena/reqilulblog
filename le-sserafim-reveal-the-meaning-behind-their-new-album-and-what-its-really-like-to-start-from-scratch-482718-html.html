The very first young lady bunch made under K-pop force to be reckoned with Hybe (the name behind BTS) just dropped the music video for their subsequent single, “Debasements,” off their sophomore EP, Antifragile.</p><p>The track is about self-assurance, claiming your blemishes and wearing the scars of past battles gladly — something that has been at the core of the five-part gathering’s personality since well before they appeared the previous spring — and a refreshingly open viewpoint in an industry frequently overwhelmed by scene.</p><p>“It isn’t so much that we’re truly ‘antifragile,'” Sakura, 24, tells Individuals of the significance behind the collection’s name. “We’re seeking after to be antifragile.</p><p>It isn’t so much that we’re truly bold [the title of their most memorable EP], similar to we’re not terrified of anything. Be that as it may, we seek after to be dauntless individuals. I trust that our fans, at whatever point they overcome fears or difficulties or catch a wall, I genuinely want to believe that they pay attention to our music and gain strength through these messages.”</p><p>Indeed, even their gathering name summons both strength and non-abrasiveness. “Our group name is a re-arranged word,” Huh Yunjin, 21, who was born in Korea yet experienced childhood in the U.S., makes sense of. “It’s ‘I’m valiant,’ and on the off chance that you change up the letters, it becomes Le Sserafim.”</p><p>The collection workmanship is likewise an ideal visual refining of strength as it mirrors Japanese Kintsugi, a fine art in what crushed ceramics is assembled spirit, the breaks filled in with gold.<br><br>Contrasted with the restless, prophetically catastrophic music video for their past single, the title track “Antifragile,” the “Contaminations” video mirrors the crudeness of the tune’s message with an extra setting and moderate style. The R&B-arched sound might return a few audience members to the ’90s, as will the style: organizing all-white outfits in various removes that wouldn’t be of put on Fate’s Kid. “We needed to show unique and various sides of Le Sserafim through this collection, so we attempted totally different styles and types too,” says Kim Chaewon, 22, the gathering’s chief, who concedes she turned into a devotee of the pop-punk sound on another melody, “No Heavenly,” while recording.</p><p>Kazuha, 19, a previous ballet performer and thriving rapper, says her main thing from the video is a champion dance second: “There’s one movement in “Pollutions” where Yunjin and I dance all together. I cherished chipping away at this along with her.” (Around 1:48 in the video above.) “I likewise thought the start of the track was delightful where we begin resting in the choreo.”</p><p>While Le Sserafim just appeared collectively in May 2022, there’s a valid justification their exhibitions and public personas feel so cleaned.</p><p>Three of the five individuals — Kim, Sakura and Huh, showed up on a music contest show in 2018, and Kim and Sakura, were previously essential for the gathering that was made from it, which disbanded in 2021. Sakura was likewise beforehand in a young lady bunch in her local Japan.</p><p>To shape Le Sserafim, they chose for go through the escalated pre-debut preparing process once more close by their new kid on the block individuals Kazuha and Hong Eunchae, 16 — and in an unquestionably brief time frame by K-pop principles. “Since it is my subsequent presentation, it was a hard choice to begin everything all along, from the student days,” says Kim.</p><p>“However, I had this particular and clear objective of what I needed to do, so I feel that assisted me with concluding that I needed to begin once again and begin new”</p><p>Adds Huh, “For my purposes, I feel like Le Sserafim was actually my last objective. Before that, there were a great deal of highs and lows.</p><p>I was persistently thumping on entryways I just subliminally knew were never going to open.” Hong, the most youthful part, was likewise the last to be added to the gathering.</p><p>“Different individuals definitely knew the tunes and the moves and I came in the center, so that filled in as a tension for me to do competently and I was stressed.</p><p>Likewise the individuals are more seasoned than me, so I was somewhat timid and it was troublesome from the outset for me to turn out to be close with them.”</p><p>However, cooperating constantly during recording meetings, dance practices and gatherings reinforced them rapidly. “Despite the fact that it tends to be viewed as exceptionally sudden, the way that we met up, I might want to feel that we were all sort of hanging tight for one another. That is the means by which I feel,” says Huh.</p><p>With two hit records added to their repertoire in seven months, Le Sserafim are focusing on what’s in store. “One of our biggest objectives right now is a world visit,” uncovers Kazuha.</p><p>“We need to show who Le Sserafim are with our exhibitions to FearNot [their being a fan bunch name] all over the planet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaKiVpL2tsY6lnGaro5q%2ForLIpmSrnaaarq1506GcZqWVlruqusZmmZ6gmaOxbsDHnqCrZZ6axG6ty5uspmWRo7Fuw8eaq2ahpKh6s7HApaOyZZyeuKZ506hkrKyRp8FustGopGark6euta%2FHZmtxamdmhW%2B006aj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html&text=Le%20Sserafim%20Reveal%20the%20Meaning%20Behind%20Their%20New%20Album%20and%20What%20Its%20Really%20Like%20to%20Start%20from%20Scra&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html&title=Le%20Sserafim%20Reveal%20the%20Meaning%20Behind%20Their%20New%20Album%20and%20What%20Its%20Really%20Like%20to%20Start%20from%20Scra" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html&title=Le%20Sserafim%20Reveal%20the%20Meaning%20Behind%20Their%20New%20Album%20and%20What%20Its%20Really%20Like%20to%20Start%20from%20Scra" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html&title=Le%20Sserafim%20Reveal%20the%20Meaning%20Behind%20Their%20New%20Album%20and%20What%20Its%20Really%20Like%20to%20Start%20from%20Scra" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fle-sserafim-reveal-the-meaning-behind-their-new-album-and-what-its-really-like-to-start-from-scratch-482718-html.html&description=Le%20Sserafim%20Reveal%20the%20Meaning%20Behind%20Their%20New%20Album%20and%20What%20Its%20Really%20Like%20to%20Start%20from%20Scra" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./linda-evangelista-was-disfigured-by-cosmetic-procedure-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Linda Evangelista Was Disfigured by Cosmetic Procedure: Details">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lady-louise-windsor-wears-black-mourns-grandad-prince-philip.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lady Louise Windsor wears black as she mourns grandfather Prince Philip">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
