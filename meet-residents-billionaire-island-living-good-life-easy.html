It is home to some of the richest people and biggest celebrities in the country. From A-list celebrities to the titans of finance and business, this exclusive community has a median home price of $21.48 million. In 2012, an anonymous Russian buyer bought a plot of land in Indian Creek Village for $47 million. At the time, it set a record for the highest-valued real estate purchase in the history of Miami-Dade County. Indian Village is home to the jet set, super models, business moguls, and entertainers. Zillow recently named Indian Creek Island Road the richest street in America. The residents of Indian Creek Village call it their billionaire bunker.</p><p>Each property on the island is on the waterfront with gorgeous views. The island features the notoriously exclusive Indian Creek Country Club. The golf course occupies the entire interior of the island. It sounds like a good place to visit, doesn't it? Don't bother unless a resident has invited you to the island. The only way onto the island is via a heavily guarded bridge. In fact, security is one of the most sought after attributes of this elite enclave. The island has its own police force that patrols the island 24 hours a day by land as well as on boats and Jet Skis.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-243024 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2017-12-22-at-11.57.45-AM.png alt width=576 height=378 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-243024 class=wp-caption-text>Photo via Don Ramey Logan/Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Let's take a look at the billionaires who inhabit the .4 square miles known as the billionaire bunker.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Julio Iglesias </a>– $300 million net worth</strong></p><p>The Latin singer put his home on the market in 2008.
