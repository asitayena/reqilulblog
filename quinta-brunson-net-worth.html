She is the daughter of Rick and Norma Jean Brunson, and she grew up in a Jehovah's Witness household with older siblings Kalid, Nija (better known as Jia), Kiyana, and Kwei. In her book, Quinta referred to her mother as a "dedicated and brilliant kindergarten teacher," and during an appearance on "The <a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson Net Worth">Kelly Clarkson</a> Show" to promote "Abbot Elementary," she revealed, "I was in my mother's class, her kindergarten class. I was in her class and I went to the same school where she taught for like six years, including kindergarten. So I rode to school with her, rode home with her, watched her work more at home. It's just getting such a different view. And I really credit my mom's experience for helping me to create the show." As a child, Brunson was very energetic, which led her mother to enroll her in ballet and aerobics classes. Quinta studied at the Charter High School for Architecture & Design and became "obsessed" with comedy as a teenager, which inspired her to take an improv class. After graduating from high school, she attended Temple University, and as a sophomore, she took classes with Chicago's famed Second City improv comedy troupe. Quinta later dropped out of college to pursue a comedy career.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Brunson gained many fans after posting funny videos on Instagram, such as the viral video series "Girl Who Has Never Been on a Nice Date." She later worked at BuzzFeed Video as a video producer, and in 2016, she sold the YouTube Red series "Broke" and the go90 series "Up for Adoption," which were both developed with BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. From 2017 to 2018, she starred in the Facebook Watch series "Quinta vs. Everything," which she also created, wrote, and produced, and in 2018, she guest-starred on Fox's "New Girl" and began a three-episode stint on ABC's "Single Parents."

Television. The studio's chairman, Channing Dungey, said of the deal, "Quinta Brunson is a tour de force and a powerhouse talent, and we are beyond thrilled to be continuing our partnership with her through this new overall deal.
