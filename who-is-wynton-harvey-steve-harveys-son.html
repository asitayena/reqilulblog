In this post, we have put down what you should know about Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey.</p><h3><strong>Summary of </strong><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Biography&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> July 18, 1997</li><li><b>Wynton Harvey’s Age: </b>26 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Parents:</strong> Steve and Mary Harvey</li><li><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Siblings:</strong> Brandi, Karli, Morgan, Jason, Lori, and Broderick</li><li><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Height in Inches:</strong>&nbsp; 5 feet 9 inches</li><li><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 182 centimeters</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the son of Steve Harvey</li><li><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Instagram:</strong> @wyntonharvey</li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> @iamwyntonharvey</li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Wynton Harvey</li></ul><h2><strong>What is Wynton Harvey’s Age Now?</strong></h2><p>Wynton Harvey is currently 26 years old. He was born on July 18, 1997, to his mom Mary Lee Harvey (neé Shackleford), and his father, Steve Harvey. He is the fourth child of Steve Harvey, the only child of his parents before they divorced in 2005. Before his parents got married, his father was previously married and had three other children.</p><h2><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Parents Had A Messy Divorce</strong></h2><p>Mary Lee Harvey is the second wife of Steve Harvey. The couple met in 1989, somewhere in Arlington while Steve was still a stand-up comedian. They got married 7 years later in 1996, only to divorce in 2005.&nbsp;Their marriage took a very ugly turn during the divorce process.</p><p>Mary made countless cruel accusations, including calling Steve Harvey out in court for destroying her life and subjecting her to a crippling lifestyle.&nbsp;Without proof, the court deemed her allegations baseless and paid no attention to them.&nbsp;After their divorce, Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey was handed to his father, Steve Harvey, as he won custody.</p><p>At the same time, the court awarded his mother ownership of three of the houses she shared with Steve, a $1.5 million payment, and a monthly payment of $40,000. Unfortunately, she ruined her chances of getting her divorce benefits when she accused Steve Harvey of child abuse and could not provide tangible evidence to support her claims.</p><h2><strong>Wynton Harvey is Believed To Have a Fine Relationship With His Father</strong></h2><p>Wynton Harvey and his father have managed to stay in each other’s good books. He has featured in some of his father’s YouTube channel videos, like the video titled Wynton and Lori Pack for College.</p><p>Aside from looks, Wynton also shares a lot in common with his father, as they both have an interest in philanthropy. In one of his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram posts</a>, Wynton shared with his followers how he and his father coincidentally wore the same color of clothes out some time. In Wynton’s words, he and his father may have an age difference of 40 years, but they are still in sync.</p><h2><strong>Wynton Harvey Has Six Other Siblings</strong></h2><p>Even though Wynton Harvey is the only child his parent had together, he is part of a much bigger family from his dad’s side. Meet his siblings.</p><h3><strong>Brandi Harvey</strong></h3><p>Brandi Harvey is Steve’s daughter with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Marcia Harvey.</a> She is a radio and TV personality, producer, and public speaker.

She shares vegan recipes, lifestyle, and exercise tips to help women live their best and healthiest life.</p><h3><strong>Karli Harvey</strong></h3><p>Karl Harvey is the other daughter of Marcia Harvey. She was born on August 20, 1982, and she is a hairdresser and a businesswoman. Besides business, Karli is also a public speaker who does a lot under this title. She mentors young people through the Harvey and Marjorie Foundation. Karli is Brandi Harvey’s twin sister. They are identical twins and have stuck with each other from conception to date.</p><h3><strong>Morgan Harvey Hawthorne</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Morgan Harvey</a> is the daughter of Marjorie Bridges, Steve Harvey’s current wife. She is a professional cook and author and runs a food blog called “Give Me Some.” Morgan was born on June 1, 1987, in the United States and is happily married to Kareem Vincent Patrick Hawthorne. Together, they have two beautiful kids named Elle Munroe Hawthorne and Marley Jean Hawthorne.</p><h3><strong>Jason Harvey</strong></h3><p>Jason Harvey is Steve’s adopted son from Marjorie Bridges.

He has become a successful businessman, fashion designer, and owner of the “Need Money Not Friends” fashion label’. He prefers to keep his life private and away from the prying eyes of the media.</p><h2><strong>Where Was Wynton Harvey’s College Education?</strong></h2><p>After a flying performance in high school, Wynton Harvey attended and graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta, Georgia, where he specialized in photography and fashion designing. He earned a bachelor’s degree in Arts in 2020.</p><p>Wynton Harvey embraced his interest in photography quite early at the age of 11 and got himself involved in photography. Consequently, he now works as a photographer and a model. He began his career as a photographer in 2016. He owns a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>website</a>&nbsp;where he showcases his art and passion for photography and fashion.</p><p>He also created a studio in Atlanta, where he does most of his work, including anything from portrait photography to landscape photography to reimagining household products.</p><h2><strong>Wynton Harvey’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Wynton Harvey’s estimated net worth hovers around half a million dollars ($500,000), and his photography outfit is a major source of his funds.

Their relationship is quite deep, but she is yet to be his wife.

His current relationship at least confirms his interest in women.</p><p>His relationship history is empty, with no evidence of any other relationship before now. Wynton has treated his celebrity status quite well and has always shown maturity, reasonably keeping facts about his love life private from the media but not a secret.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Wynton Harvey, Steve Harvey’s Son</strong></h2><li>What is Wynton Harvey known for?<br>Wynton Harvey is known as a young social media personality and photographer from the United States, and the son of the American comedian and actor Steve Harvey.</li><li>Who is Wynton Harvey’s mother?<br>Wynton Harvey’s mother is Mary Shackleford, who was one of Steve Harvey’s ex-wives.</li><li>Does Wynton Harvey have siblings?<br>Yes, Wynton Harvey has six siblings from his father’s other marriages.</li><li>Where did Wynton Harvey study?<br>Wynton Harvey studied at Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta, Georgia, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2020.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s religion?<br>Wynton Harvey is a devout Muslim.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s net worth?<br>Wynton Harvey has an alleged net worth of $500,000, primarily from his photography works.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s Instagram account?<br>Wynton Harvey’s Instagram account is @wyntonharvey, with over 91,000 followers.</li><li>Who is Wynton Harvey’s girlfriend?<br>Wynton Harvey’s girlfriend is Taylor Gordon, the daughter of American television journalist Ed Gordon.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s height and weight?<br>Wynton Harvey stands at 5 feet 9 inches (175 centimeters) and weighs 143 pounds (65 kilograms).</li><li>What does Wynton Harvey do?<br>Wynton Harvey is a social media personality, photographer, human rights activist, and philanthropist.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s involvement in the Black Lives Matter movement?<br>Wynton Harvey is an avid supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and has participated in at least one peaceful protest for the movement.</li><li>Who won custody of Wynton Harvey after his parents’ divorce?<br>The court granted full custody of Wynton Harvey to his father, Steve Harvey, after a custody battle with his mother.</li><li>What is Wynton Harvey’s passion besides photography?<br>Wynton Harvey is also interested in fashion and dreams of becoming a fashion designer in his career.</li><li>When did Wynton Harvey launch his professional photography career?<br>Wynton Harvey launched his professional photography career in 2016 when he was 20 years old.</li><li>Who is Wynton Harvey’s elder half-sister, and what is she known for?<br>Wynton Harvey’s elder half-sister is Brandi Harvey, who is a successful entrepreneur and activist.
