There, they found Lauren Kanarek in a severe condition, as well as the one who was responsible for what had happened to her. The episode of “48 Hours” on CBS News titled “The Shooting of Lauren Kanarek” details the legal repercussions of the incident as well as the causes that led to the shooting. Then, shall we investigate this further, shall we?</p><figure id=attachment_60647 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-60647 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Lauren Kanarek</figure><h2>What Ended Up Taking Place with Lauren Kanarek?</h2><p>Lauren Kanarek is a skilled equestrian who has been recognised for her accomplishments by both the United States Equestrian Federation and the United States Dressage Federation with medals. She enjoyed ice skating and music when she was younger, and at one point she even entertained the idea of becoming a lawyer. But in the end, Lauren decided that becoming a dressage instructor was the path that most interested her. She was preparing for the event at a horse farm in Washington Township, where she also lived with her fiance, Robert Goodwin, in the days preceding up to the tragedy.</p><p>Lauren called 911 at approximately 2:15 p.m. on August 7, 2019, and reported that she had been shot twice in the chest. The authorities responded to her report. The perpetrator was armed with a revolver with a 9mm calibre, and when the police arrived at the scene, they found Robert grappling with the offender. After being taken to the hospital, Lauren required immediate surgical intervention in order to be stabilised and begin the healing process. After that, the authorities began their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Lauren’s shooting death.</p><h2>Who Made an Attempt to Take the Life of Lauren Kanarek?</h2><p>The investigation uncovered the fact that Lauren Kanarek had started training at the horse farm in March 2018 under the tutelage of Michael Barisone, a renowned dressage coach who was also an Olympic equestrian in the past. In the past, he had also coached a number of athletes who competed in the Olympics. At the time, Lauren was paying Robert a monthly rent of $5,000 to board her horses, train them, and allow her to live on the farm with him. Nonetheless, by the summer of 2019, things had taken a decidedly unfavourable turn.</p><p>According to the testimony, Lauren was dissatisfied with the training; she desired to have Michael tutor her, rather than one of his assistants. As a direct consequence of this, Lauren, who is very engaged on social media, started publishing a number of complaints online. One of them had the following message written on it: “It’s nearly time to perhaps go to war. Anyone who continually kicks a sleeping beast will, at some point, cause the beast to wake up! She went as far as accusing Michael of being “racist, homophobic, and antisemitic,” all of which he fiercely rejected. She even went as far as accusing him of being “antisemitic.”</p><p>Michael asserted that a verbal agreement between the three parties to vacate the premises after the training was over had been broken by the couple. On the other hand, according to Lauren, Michael made an attempt to evict them after he and his fiancée were forced to relocate to a barn on the property because of the flood. She claimed that Michael had shown an interest in relocating to the same home that Lauren and Robert were occupying. In the days preceding up to the shooting, the authorities were summoned to the location multiple times due to Lauren’s constant posts on social media, and they eventually responded to the scene of the shooting.</p><p>Michael had earlier reported to the authorities that Lauren and Robert were squatting on his property, labelling them as harassers who refused to leave. He also claimed that they had refused to leave. Then, Lauren alleged on social media that she was the victim of bullying and that she was terrified of the situation. In addition, she and Robert are said to have phoned child protective services, who then showed up at the farm to investigate allegations that Michael had abused the children that he shares with his partner. After further investigation, however, he was exonerated of any misconduct by a social worker.</p><p>Michael drove all the way down to where Lauren and Robert were staying on the 7th of August, 2019, and he brought a gun with him. After determining that Michael was the gunman, Lauren later stated that Michael also attempted to shoot Robert but failed to hit him. After then, Robert managed to get Michael under control until the cops arrived. At the trial of Michael, which took place in the beginning of 2022, Lauren’s online posts were a contentious issue. Mary Haskins Gray, who was his partner at the time, stated in court that Lauren made threats online.</p><p>Lauren did acknowledge that some of her posts could be interpreted as threats, but she claimed that she was unaware of this possibility at the time she wrote them. Michael later said that he reported his concerns about his safety to the authorities, but that they did not take his statements seriously. In the end, his attorneys attempted to construct a defence based on insanity by having specialists testify that Lauren’s insults on social media drove him beyond the point of no return. Michael was found not guilty of attempting to murder Lauren and Robert in April 2022, and he was subsequently mandated to attend mental health therapy after being found not guilty. He stated that he had no recollection of the shooting.</p><h2>A decline in status or favour</h2><p>Michael Barisone, one of the most accomplished dressage riders in the United States, competed for Team USA at the Olympic Dressage Competition in Beijing in 2008. He went on to have a successful career as a trainer, during which he trained several Olympians as well as top-level cyclists.</p><p>But beginning in the summer of 2019, his life began to spin out of control as his relationship with Kanarek came to an end as a result of conflicts about the arrangement they had.</p><h2>Lauren Kanarek targets Michael Barisone on Facebook</h2><p>On Facebook, Lauren Kanarek started venting her anger and aggravation with regard to Barisone.<br>Michael Barisone appeared to be profoundly affected by Lauren Kanarek’s remarks on social media as the situation at the farm continued to deteriorate, as he had the impression that his reputation and profession were being put in jeopardy. Barisone vehemently rejected her accusations against her.<br>Kanarek and Barisone have both reported having the experience of being in danger.<br>According to Barisone and those who support him, his mental health was deteriorating.</p><h2>The weapon that was utilised</h2><p>Michael Barisone took a 9mm Ruger revolver out of a safe in his office on the afternoon of August 7, 2019, and then drove to the farmhouse on the property where Lauren Kanarek and Rob Goodwin were residing. He confronted them both and demanded to know why they were there.</p><h2>A struggle ensues</h2><p>Rob Goodwin claimed that he was successful in bringing Michael Barisone to the ground with a tackle.<br>Lauren Kanarek dialled 911 despite the fact that she was gravely hurt and struggling to breathe. This picture was taken at the hospital shortly after the shooting, and it shows Goodwin sitting on top of Barisone, who appeared to have suffered significant injuries as a result of the beating.</p><h2>Lauren Kanarek strives for her life</h2><p>Because Lauren Kanarek was haemorrhaging uncontrollably, she had to be rushed to the hospital for emergent surgery. According to Kanarek, who is seen here in the hospital with a ventilator, she was in a coma for four days and stayed in the intensive care unit for three weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1663453618_773_The-Assault-on-Lauren-Kanarek-Who-Tried-to-Kill-Her.jpg><h2>According to Barisone, the only thing he remembers is waking up in handcuffs</h2><p>Michael Barisone claims that he does not recall getting the gun or shooting Lauren Kanarek. He also claims that he does not remember being shot. He claims that the only thing he remembers is waking up in a hospital with one of his arms restrained to the bed with handcuffs.</p><p>The next day following the shooting, Barisone was taken into custody and charged with two charges of attempted murder.</p><h2>The equestrian career of Barisone has a long list of accomplishments to its credit</h2><p>Barisone is the owner of the facility known as Barisone Dressage, which is where Kanarek was shot.<br>Dressage was the discipline that Barisone competed in at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, and she performed it on horseback (his team did not medal). Now a well-known teacher for other top-tier equestrians, he conducts his lessons at his own facilities in both New Jersey and Florida.</p><p>According to the information provided in his official biography, Barisone was a member of the team that competed in the 1997 Nations Cup and won the gold medal at Hickstead. Additionally, Barisone has reportedly trained nine different horses to victory in over one hundred CDI Grand Prix competitions. In addition to that, the Sportsman International Horseman of the Year award was bestowed upon him in 2009. He has also coached younger Olympians, such as Alison Brock, who was a part of the United States team that won bronze in the 2016 Olympics in Rio.</p><p>#Assault #Lauren #Kanarek #Kill</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiroZ1dlsC0rdSlq2annmK5osHRnqVmo5GjrrOxymauoaddqb%2BqscNmq6hlm565rXnHnqlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html&text=Who%20Tried%20to%20Kill%20Her%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html&title=Who%20Tried%20to%20Kill%20Her%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html&title=Who%20Tried%20to%20Kill%20Her%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html&title=Who%20Tried%20to%20Kill%20Her%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-assault-on-lauren-kanarek-who-tried-to-kill-her.html&description=Who%20Tried%20to%20Kill%20Her%3f%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-was-michael-haight-utah-father-kills-his.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Michael Haight?
