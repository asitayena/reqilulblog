The American rapper and actor has, however, dated several women over the years and is currently in a relationship with Jamira Haines aka Cuban Link.</strong></p><p>50 Cent whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III became popular for his streetwise raps How We Do, Candy Shop, and Disco Inferno. He is also celebrated for his Get Rich or Die Tryin‘ album, which was a huge commercial success. Moreover, besides his professional career, 50 Cent’s love life which at the moment revolves around Jamira has been systematically followed.</p><h2><strong>50 Cent is Not Married and Does Not Have a Wife</strong></h2><p>50 Cent is not married but has been romantically involved with many women most of who have a career in the American entertainment industry. The rapper has been named one of the top American celebrities with the longest list of girlfriends. He is also a father of two children whom he had with two of the women he dated.</p><h2><strong>50 Cent and Jamira ‘Cuban Link’ Haines Have Been Together Since 2019</strong></h2><p>Apart from his thriving music career, fans seem to be interested in 50 Cent’s dating history. Jamira is a model and Instagram influencer and is 26 years old. She is also a fitness trainer and businesswoman who runs her own brand, Cuban Fit. According to her Instagram bio, Haines is also an aspiring corporate lawyer.</p><p>The couple reportedly started dating in 2019 after they met at the Premier of 50 Cent’s show “Power” and has remained together ever since then. The public only knew about their relationship after they both officially announced it on Instagram. Jamira is the most recent woman to be added to Cent’s list of girlfriends and they seem to be happy and comfortable with each other.</p><p>In 2022, Jamira got embroiled in a longstanding feud 50 Cent had with American rapper, The Game. The two rap stars have been at loggerheads since 2005 when 50 Cent’s song The Massacre was pushed back in order to give The Game’s debut album more importance, given that they both were then in the same rap group, G-Unit.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2022, The Game, allegedly in a bid to get back at 50 Cent, outed Jamira for having DMed him. “Oh’ n tell ya girl stay out of my DM’s… if she don’t want her man overweight, fat as f***…”, The Game ridiculed. He also reported that Jamira had sent him her topless photos alongside her phone number with the caption “video girl?? Keep in mind.”</p><h2><strong>All The Women 50 Cent Has Dated in the Past</strong></h2><h3><strong>Shaniqua Tompkins</strong></h3><p>50 Cent’s first known relationship was with Shaniqua Tompkins and it lasted from 1994 to 1998. In the course of their relationship, Shaniqua gave birth to their son Marquise Jackson. The two reportedly began to have issues after 50 Cent allegedly assaulted her physically. They eventually fell out over money, child support, and housing.</p><p>In 2009, Tompkins sued Jackson for $50 million on the account that he promised to take care of her for life. However, the suit was dismissed by a judge by tagging it “an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour.” Ever since then, Shaniqua and 50 have been known for constantly throwing shades at each other on social media and exchanging mean words.</p><h3><strong>Meagan Good</strong></h3><p>Cent got into another public relationship in 2002 with Meagan Good, an American actress known for her role as Mya in the 2012 romantic drama Think Like A Man. Details of their relationship and what led to their breakup are not publicly available. But, one notable thing is that to date, Meagan always has kind and nice things to say about 50 Cent.</p><p>According to the Think Like A Man actress, Cent is a very good and gentle man, unlike his public persona which shows him to be a tough man. Meanwhile, Meagan Good later married (and divorced) American Preacher DeVon Franklin.</p><h3><strong>Vivica A. Fox</strong></h3><p>Vivica A. Fox is an American actress who dated 50 Cent for some months between 2003 and 2004. Just like Meagan Good, Vivica remembers only fond moments she had with 50 Cent. In an interview with Vlad Tv, she described him as the “love of her life” and stated that he is a gentleman and very generous.</p><p>Responding to the question on why they broke up, Vivica <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>said</a> that many people began to come into their business because they went too public with the relationship, hence, they couldn’t keep it going.</p><h3><strong>Joy Bryant</strong></h3><p>50 Cent and Joy Bryant starred together in the 2005 American music and crime drama, Get Rich or Die Tryin’. After the movie, they started dating, but the relationship lasted just for a while as they would split in 2006. They probably had thought their onscreen chemistry would be the same in a real-life relationship but sadly, that was not the case.</p><p>Regardless, the two are still on good terms and have continued their professional relationship and featuring in movies together.</p><h3><strong>50 Cent and Paris Hilton Dated in 2008</strong></h3><p>In 2008, speculations began to spread that 50 Cent and Paris Hilton, an American media personality, were in a romantic relationship. This rumor was sparked after the two were seen together from time to time acting all loved up. Paris allegedly dumped her then-boyfriend for 50 Cent.</p><p>Particularly, Hilton and 50 were spotted in Casino in Las Vegas and Hard Rock Hotel during 50 Cent’s launch party for his Curtis studio album. To date, neither party confirmed their romance nor addressed the speculations.</p><h3><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></h3><p>The rap boss and Chelsea Handler, an American comedian and actress, dated sometime in 2010. But, things did not work out between them as they separated just after a couple of months. Initially, after their split, the two remained on good terms but later fell out in 2020 after 50 Cent publicly declared his support for Donald Trump.</p><h3><strong>Daphne Joy</strong></h3><p>Daphne Joy is a Filipino actress and model who started a relationship with 50 Cent in 2011. The relationship birthed their only child Sire Jackson in 2012. They broke up following the birth of Sire. Joy charged Cent with domestic violence after he allegedly kicked her during an argument and ransacked her room. 50 Cent pled guilty to a count of vandalism and faced three years of probation.</p><p>Daphne Joy, even though they had a child together has since moved on with her life as she is reportedly dating American rap boss and record producer, Puff Daddy.</p><h3><strong>Ciara</strong></h3><p>According to records, 50 Cent’s most popular relationship was the one he had with Ciara, an American R&B singer, and songwriter. The couple had off and on again relationship between 2007 and 2012. While they were together, they were the envy of many given their constant public display of affection on social media.</p><p>They also worked together on several projects and attained several feats. However, as the story goes, tables turned and they decided to go their separate ways.</p><h3><strong>Tattedup Holly</strong></h3><p>Instagram model popular for her many tattoos, Tatted-up Holly dated 50 Cent in 2013. The couple broke up in 2015 following allegations of physical and emotional abuse from Holly. Holly took to her Instagram to respond to the allegations and wrote; “I treated this man like royalty but all I got in return was ass whippings…he would buy me gifts only to take them back. What a man!”</p><h4><strong>List of The Women 50 Cent Has Dated in the Past</strong></h4><li>Shaniqua Tompkins (1994-1998)</li><li>Meagan Good (2002-2003)</li><li>Vivica A.
