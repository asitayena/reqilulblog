また、旦那さんとの間に生まれた子供との関係も素敵で、母親としても素晴らしい方です。
今日は冨永愛さんの過去の恋愛と結婚、離婚、そして子供との関係について書いてみたいと思います。
そして、恋愛だけでなく、人気アーティスト・長渕剛さんとの特殊な友情の形についても書いてみたいと思います。
冨永愛の結婚と離婚理由。元旦那はパリ在住の日本人パティシエ 冨永愛さんは２００４年にパリ在住の日本人のパティシエの方と結婚しています。
当時の冨永愛さんは２２歳で、メディアでは”世界で活躍する日本人モデル”として注目され始めたばかりの時期でした。
話題になり始めたばかりのあの頃に、実はすでに結婚していたと思うとビックリですね！
そして、結婚した翌年の２００５年の３月に男の子を出産したということで、授かり婚だったとされています。
２３歳で第一子を産んだということになります。
その後、2008年には旦那と別居されていることが報道されました。
この時、冨永愛さんはブログで、
「息子が幼稚園に通うことになったので、通園の拠点を考えたうえで引越ししたと本人から聞いています。もちろん普通にケンカもあるでしょうが、それはどこの夫婦でもあることでしょう」
「夫婦は山あり谷ありで、喧嘩もしますが（記事は多少過大）、3人で頑張っています」
と報道の内容を否定されました。
しかし、２００９年に離婚したことが報道されました。
その際にはブログで、
「どこの夫婦にもあるように、私達にも色々な事がありました」
「夫婦として歩んで行く中で、お互いのすれ違いや、進むべき道を見据えた上で、別々の道を歩んで行った方が、お互いにとっていいだろうと判断致しました」
「一生一緒に生きて行こうと誓った仲ですし、大切な息子もいますから、この決断は簡単に出した答えではありません。」
「もちろん母として、息子と二人で生きて行く不安はありますが、私らしく、前向きに生きて行こうと思います！ 皆さんこれからも温かい目で見守っていて下さい」
と、当時の離婚報道の内容の一部を否定しながらも、苦渋の決断で離婚したことを明かしていました。
当時、冨永さんは元旦那との離婚報道を否定されていましたが、それはプライベートな情報を守るためだったとされています。
冨永愛と旦那の離婚理由は嫉妬深さ。モラハラ説や収入格差説はガセ。元夫はどんな人だった？ 冨永愛さんの元旦那さんは年上でした。
馴れ初めは冨永愛さんがパリコレモデル時代にパリで出会っています。
元旦那さんの写真や、詳しい情報は公表されていませんが、現在の息子の姿から想像すると、章胤さんの眉毛とまつ毛は冨永愛さんよりも太く濃く、重いまぶたでより吊り上がった目をしているということで、毛が濃くて一重から奥二重の吊り目の男性だったのではないか？と憶測されています。
旦那との離婚の理由としては、冨永さん自身がのちに、
「嫉妬深いことが原因だった」
と語っています。
当時の週刊誌の報道の中には、
・パーティで冨永さんがノリでバニーガールのコスプレをしたら、旦那さんが大激怒。大勢の前で冨永さんに土下座謝罪を要求した。
・収入格差ゆえに夫婦でのすれ違いが起きていた。
という内容が書かれていましたが、それに対してはブログで、
「私達夫婦はご存知の通り海外を行き来する機会が多く、こういった事を招いてしまったと思っています。皆様にはご心配をかけた事と思いますが、特にそういう事実もありませんので、ご心配なさらないで下さい」
と否定していました。
離婚をブログで報告した際には、「彼が将来幸せになってくれる事を願っています」と綴られており、決して喧嘩別れをしたわけではなさそうです。
冨永愛の歴代の熱愛報道。離婚後に塩谷瞬と熱愛するも２股事件で破局。山本太郎や紀里谷とも関係 冨永愛さんが離婚後に熱愛の噂が出たのは2011年頃です。
当時は俳優として活躍されていた山本太郎さんと交際されていました。
冨永さんと山本太郎さんは、原発の問題で意気投合し交際に発展したのです。
冨永さんから結婚を意識していたそうですが、山本太郎さんはそこまでの将来は考えておらず、結局は破局してしまいました。
その後に、2012年頃に俳優の塩谷瞬さんと交際しました。
俳優の塩谷瞬さんとはお付き合いの末、プロポーズまで受けていたようです。
しかし、神田うのさんの提示した証拠で、塩谷瞬さんが料理研究家の園田真希絵さんにもプロポーズしていることが発覚したのです。
三角関係であったことが発覚すると、塩谷さんは世間からもうバッシングを受け、カメラの前で涙ながら謝罪することとなりました。
塩谷さんは二股交際の事実を認め、2人に直接会って謝罪したそうです。もちろん2人とは破局しました。
ただ、後に冨永さんも塩谷さんと交際した時点で山本太郎さんと完全に切れてなかったとの噂があるので、本当ならどっちもどっちですね・・・。
ちなみ、当時の週刊誌では、
「愛ちゃんは大きくなっていく息子さんのためには、男親がいたほうがいいと考えるようになったんです。山本さんとの関係がダメになっていく一方で、塩谷くんも気になっていったんじゃないですか。それで、山本さんと別れ、出会って間もないけど、自分だけでなく、子供のことも愛してくれる塩谷くんと、急速に親密になっていったんです」（前出・冨永の知人）
と、当時の冨永さんが、我が子の為に新しいお父さんを求めていたことが伝えられており、その焦りが出てしまったのではないか？とされています。
紀里谷や長渕剛とも熱愛の噂があった。不倫はガセネタ 冨永愛さんの元カレとして有名なのが山本太郎さんと塩谷瞬さんですが、その他にも噂になった有名人が何人かいます。
2011年頃から山本太郎さんと交際した冨永愛さんですが、実はその1年前に映画監督の紀里谷さんとも噂になっていたのです。
紀里谷さんといえば、宇多田ヒカルさんの元旦那であるということで、当時はバツイチ同士の大物カップルが誕生だと話題になっていました。
2010年に”今年に入って何度も紀里谷和明さんとは二人でデートしていた”と報じられたのです。
ただ、その関係については紀里谷さんは、「朝起きてビックリ。残念ながらこれ事実じゃないんですけど」と否定。
冨永愛さんも「本当じゃないんです。いいお友達です」と、二人とも熱愛報道を否定しています。
２人とも国際的な舞台で活躍されているということで、友人関係であることは事実のようです。</description></item><item><title>'Big Bang Theory' Cast Take Pay Cuts for Costars' Raises: Report</title><link>/big-bang-theory-cast-take-pay-cuts-for-costars-raises-report-w469863.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/big-bang-theory-cast-take-pay-cuts-for-costars-raises-report-w469863.html</guid><description>How generous!

I’m assuming it’s 10/2 with ground? It is OK to use a wire that is somewhat bigger than necessary for safety reasons. Mechanically, a #10 should fit in the breaker just fine (check the breaker’s specifications), however it may not fit in the GFCI.
As a result, is it permissible to utilise 10 gauge wire for outlets? Wire Gauge for 240-Volt Electrical Outlets Because of voltage drop, 10-gauge wire is the minimum wire size for a 30-amp 240-volt circuit, but you should consider upgrading to 8-gauge if the outlet is located far enough from the panel to avoid poor performance as a result of voltage drop.</description></item><item><title>Casa di Langa Hotel Review, Piedmont</title><link>/casa-di-langa-hotel.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/casa-di-langa-hotel.html</guid><description>Piedmont, Italy The brightest star in Piedmont’s expanding luxury hotel firmament.

メンバーの変わった経歴やステータスが話題になりがちです。
サチモスの中でもイケメンのビジュアルリーダーとして人気の、
TAIKING（タイキング）さんも、
実は、かなりのハイスペック男子なのです。
有名なのでは、父親が元サッカー日本代表の、
戸塚哲也さんだってことが知られてます。
TAIKINGの結婚観と彼女にしたいタイプ サチモスは若いイメージがありますが、
ボーカルのヨンスさんを除いては大人メンバーが多いです。
売れる前に結婚してるような方はいないのか、
特にイケメンメンバーであるTAIKINGさんの色恋関係が気になりますね！
インスタにて甥っ子がよく登場するので、
一瞬「彼の子供！？」と焦りますが、
実際は子供はもちろん、結婚もされてません。。笑
どんな女性が好みなのかわかりませんが、
以前に同じ音楽をやってる女性は、
音楽を純粋に楽しめなくなりそうだとして、
同業者は嫌だと語っていました。
きっと結婚相手だけでなくて、
自分の彼女にも、変に耳の肥えた方は嫌なのかなと。
サチモスの王子的な存在なので、
やっぱり、それなりの美女とお付き合いして欲しいですね！
TAIKING(ｻﾁﾓｽ)の父は元日本代表 TAIKINGさんの本名は「戸塚泰貴（とつかたいき）」です。
父の戸塚哲也さんはヴェルディやレイソルで活躍し、
８０年代の日本代表で活躍されたスター選手です。
Jリーグが発足する前の時代の日本代表なので、
カズさん世代らよりも前でマイナーに見られがちですが、
今の日本のサッカーリーグや有名校の指導者などは、
大概は、この８０年代に活躍された方です。
TAIKINGさんの父の哲也さんも、
サッカー指導者としても一流の経歴を誇り、
これまでにプロサッカーチームの監督を何度も務めています。
今年のワールドカップのテーマに、
TAIKINGさんが所属するサチモスが選ばれたのも、
何かの縁のように感じますね！
また、一時期は川崎で焼肉屋を経営されるなど、
その積極的でアクティブな経歴が素敵ですね！
息子のTAIKINGさんも好奇心旺盛な人生を歩み成功されて、親子揃ってかっこいいですね！
TAIKINGの出身中学や高校は？ TAIKINGさんは横浜出身ですが、出身の学校も横浜です。
中学はわかりませんが、
小学校は横浜市立 桜岡小学校出身だそうです。
音楽の専門学校に行ったということで、
父と同じサッカーの道に行かなかったそうです。
運動では水泳を４年間習ってた時期があったそうです。
スマートなスタイルをしてるので、
運動神経はかなり良さそうな・・・。
