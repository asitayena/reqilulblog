And while he is arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, only a tiny fraction of his billion dollar net worth actually came from his salaries while playing with the Bulls and later the Wizards. In fact, Jordan "only" made a total of $93 million during his NBA playing days.
Of course, when you're considered the greatest player to ever play the game by most basketball purists, you can earn money in other ways.
