She spent her entire childhood and adolescence in the city and was raised by her parents, both of whom are of Haitian descent. She attended Park West High School. She moved out on her own during her teenage years and opted to not attend college, as she needed to continue working in order to have enough money to cover her rent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342660 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Mona-Scott-Young-1.jpg alt="Mona Scott Young Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342660 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=music-manager><strong>Music Manager</strong></h2><p>Scott did not initially set out to have a career in music, management, and production, though she always knew she had a savvy business mind. She was working at Radio City Music Hall in New York City when she was approached by the Brooklyn group TrackMasters to join the organization as their manager. She decided to accept the position, which would change the trajectory of her career. Through her position with TrackMasters, she met music executive <a href=# title="Chris Lighty Net Worth">Chris Lighty</a>. Together, in 1996, the two co-founded the music management company Violator. Over the next decade, Scott helped direct Violator to become a seriously successful company which helped launch or revitalize the careers of artists like Busta Rhymes, LL Cool J, <a href=# title="Q-Tip Net Worth">Q-Tip</a>, <a href=# title="Foxy Brown Net Worth">Foxy Brown</a>, <a href=# title="Ja Rule Net Worth">Ja Rule</a>, <a href=# title="Mobb Deep Net Worth">Mobb Deep</a>, 50 Cent, <a href=# title="Mariah Carey Net Worth">Mariah Carey</a>, Fantasia, and Missy Elliot.</p><h2 id=reality-tv-empire><strong>Reality TV Empire</strong></h2><p>After experiencing significant success with Violator, Scott decided to transition into working in television in 2005.

The same year, she also created her own television production company, Monami Productions.</p><p>In 2006, Jim Ackerman, a director at VH1, approached Scott in hopes that she would help him develop a new reality show centered on rapper <a href=# title="Jim Jones Net Worth">Jim Jones</a>. However, Scott moved the show concept in another direction. She had noticed the popularity of female ensemble-driven shows at the time and thought it would be a good idea to focus the show on Jim Jones' girlfriend, <a href=# title="Chrissy Lampkin Net Worth">Chrissy Lampkin</a>, and her circle of friends. The resulting show, called "Love & Hip Hop," went on to become a huge success, with Scott acting as producer through Monami Productions.</p><p>The show has since spawned an entire media franchise and a variety of spin-off series like "Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta," "Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood," "Love & Hip Hop: Miami," "Chrissy & Mr. Jones," "K. Michelle: My Life," "<a href=# title="Stevie J Net Worth">Stevie J</a> & Joseline: Go Hollywood," and "Leave it to Stevie," all of which have been produced by Monami Productions. Scott has spoken about how proud she is of "Love & Hip Hop" as it has put Black American culture more in the spotlight and has provided a number of jobs for people of color both in front of and behind the camera.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-238966 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Mona-Scott-Young.jpg alt width=516 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-238966 class=wp-caption-text>Bennett Raglin/Getty Images</p><p>Monami Productions has also produced a number of other series and specials including "Donald Trump Presents: The Ultimate Merger," "Cocaine: History Between the Lines," "The Gossip Game," and "This is Hot 97."
