Shia LaBeouf first rose to fame appearing on the Disney Channel show, "Even Stevens". He gained a wider audience with appearances in family-friendly projects like "The Even Stevens Movie" and "Holes".&nbsp; His childhood, however, was anything but Disney-like, and included bouts of abuse and periods of poverty. This tough childhood has spilled over somewhat into his personal life. He has occasionally made dubious decisions, which have resulted in fistfights, evictions from bars, arrests, and multiple court dates. Since the end of the "The Transformers" franchise, he has publicly stated that he wants to concentrate on independent film for the foreseeable future.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Shia Saide LaBeouf was born on June 11, 1986, in Los Angeles, California. His mother Shayna was a ballerina who became a visual artist and jewelry designer. His dad Jeffrey is a Vietnam War veteran who bounced from job to job. His mother is Jewish while his father is of Cajun French descent. LaBeouf identifies as Jewish. His first name is derived from Szaja, the Polish version of the Hebrew Yeshayahu (Isaiah), meaning "God is salvation" and his middle name is his mother's maiden name.&nbsp;LaBeouf has characterized his parents as hippies.</p><p>His father was a heroin addict who abused LaBeouf.&nbsp;His parents divorced and LaBeouf grew in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles with his mother. He attended the 32nd Street Visual and Performing Arts Magnet in Los Angeles and Alexander Hamilton High School officiallyâ€“although he received most of his education from tutors on set. LaBeouf began performing stand-up at comedy clubs when he was 10 years old. He found an agent through in the Yellow Pages and pretended to be his own manager in the initial phone call. LaBeouf initially became an actor because his family was broke, not because he wanted to pursue an acting career. Soon after he got an agent, LaBeouf was cast as Louis Stevens in the Disney Channel show "Even Stevens."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>"Even Stevens" ran between 2000 and 2003 and aired 65 episodes during that time. He won a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance in the show. In 2007, then-21-year-old LaBeouf started to get noticed for his roles in feature films. He received critical praise for the movie "Disturbia." The movie that really launched Shia LaBeouf into A-List status was "Transformers." Other notable roles include the 2008's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"&nbsp; and two "Transformers" sequels.</p><p>In February 2014, Shia LaBeouf made several strange public appearances. One time he walked a red carpet wearing a paper bag over his face that was decorated with the words "I am not famous anymore." No one was quite sure what his intentions were. Some speculated it was part of a performance art piece. As it turns out, these actions were a performance art piece that LaBeouf created with British artist and author Luke Turner and Finnish artist Nastja SÃ¤de RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ as a meditation on celebrity and vulnerability.&nbsp;Since then, LaBeouf, RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ & Turner have engaged in numerous high-profile performance art projects, including #IAMSORRY (2014), #ALLMYMOVIES (2015), #TOUCHMYSOUL (2015), #TAKEMEANYWHERE (2016), and HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US (2017â€“present).</p><p>LaBeouf took on the role of iconic tennis player <a href=# title="John McEnroe Net Worth">John McEnroe</a> in the 2017 Swedish film "Borg vs McEnroe." In 2019, he starred in the comedy-drama "The Peanut Butter Falcon" and he also wrote and starred in "Honey Boy." In 2020, he appeared in "The Tax Collector" and "Pieces of a Woman." In 2022, LaBeouf starred in the Italian-German biographical movie "Padre Pio" and was cast in a lead role in "Megalopolis."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162194 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Shia-LaBeouf.jpg alt="Shia LaBeouf" width=434 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-162194 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=plagiarism-issues><strong>Plagiarism Issues</strong></h2><p>In late 2013, Shia was accused of plagiarism for his short film "Howard Cantour.com," which he released on the internet. Shortly after the film went up online, several bloggers noticed how similar it was to a 2007 comic called "Justin M. Damiano," by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Shia took the film offline and claimed that he did not intend to copy Clowes. He insisted he was "inspired" by him and "got lost in the creative process."</p><p>Since the discovery of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under scrutiny. LaBeouf's graphic novels, "Let's Fucking Party" and "Stale N Mate," were plagiarized from BenoÃ®t Duteurtre's "The Little Girl and the Cigarette" and <a href=# title="Charles Bukowski Net Worth">Charles Bukowski</a>'s "Assault," respectively.</p><p>LaBeouf talked about the plagiarism accusations against him in early 2014. He revealed that he thought copyright laws were too restrictiveâ€“they did not allow ideas to flow freely. He then took to Twitter to describe his next project, Daniel Boring, which is a clear reference to David Boring, another comic created by Clowes. Furthermore, the description of the story was also completely plagiarized from Clowes. LaBoeuf received a cease-and-desist letter from Clowes' attorneys. Shia posted it on Twitter.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296044 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Shia-LaBeouf-1.jpg alt width=900 height=637 sizes="(max-width: 2279px) 100vw, 2279px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296044 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>LaBeouf met English actress <a href=# title="Mia Goth Net Worth">Mia Goth</a> on the set of "Nymphomaniac in 2012." The two later became romantically involved. The couple appeared to get married in Las Vegas by an <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> impersonator. That turned out to be a hoax. Then, on an appearance on The <a href=# title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show he said they were married. In the fall of 2018, the couple filed for divorce. He dated FKA Twigs from 2018 to 2019 and <a href=# title="Margaret Qualley Net Worth">Margaret Qualley</a> from 2020 to 2021. LaBeouf and Goth reconciled in February 2022, and they had their first child, a daughter, in March 2022.</p><p>After <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a> was elected, Shia became one of the most vocal anti-Trump celebrities. He set up an art installation to protest Trump, but the installation was taken down several times by opponents. In July 2017, Shia was arrested for being drunk in public in Georgia. While in custody he was recorded delivering a belligerent rant.</p><p>LaBeouf was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing at the Studio 54 theatre in Manhattan in June 2014. The arrest report states that he was "acting disorderly, yelling, and being loud." He also swore at and spit at the officers. LaBeouf voluntarily entered outpatient treatment for alcoholism after this incident.</p><p>LaBeouf was arrested in the middle of the night for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and obstruction in downtown Savannah, Georgia on July 8, 2017. A few months later, he pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct charges. He was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. He was also ordered to seek help for his anger and substance abuse issues.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-233160 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-457273190.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-233160 class=wp-caption-text>Kris Connor/Getty Images</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf-salary-highlights><strong>Shia LaBeouf Salary Highlights</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Shia earned $400,000 for his role in the historical drama "Bobby." He earned $400,000 each for "Disturbia" and "Surf's Up." In 2010 he earned $8 million for "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."</p><h2 id=transformers-earnings><strong>Transformers Earnings</strong></h2><p>Shia earned $750,000 for the first "Transformers" movie. His paycheck was bumped to $5 million for the second installment and $15 million for the third. He gave up another $15 million when he chose not to star in the fourth installment. He reportedly demanded $18 million, which was denied. So in total, he earned $20.75 million from Transformers before taxes.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In March 2020, Shia paid $5.475 million for a gorgeous home in Pasadena, California.</p><p>In 2009 he paid $1.8 million for a home in Sherman Oaks, California. He listed this home for sale in July 2020 for $2.25 million. He sold this home in September of that year for $2.4 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMCptcBmo5qalaTCp3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html&text=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshia-labeouf-net-worth.html&description=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sterling-campbell-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sterling Campbell Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./scott-evans-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scott Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
