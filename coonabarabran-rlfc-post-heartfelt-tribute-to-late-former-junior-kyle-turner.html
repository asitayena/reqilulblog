He was such a tough, uncompromising player on the field, yet a lovely, generous man off the field.</p><p>“We offer our full support to his family and friends at this very difficult time, and he will always be remembered at our Club as a man that delivered a premiership to the Rabbitohs, but also a man that connected deeply with his communities.</p><p>“We will hold him close to our hearts for the rest of this season and in the years to come. Vale Kyle Turner.”</p><p>Tributes are flowing for the former NRL star online, with many fans expressing their shock over the tragic news.</p><p>“Rest in peace Kyle Turner. So sad to hear he has passed away,” one woman wrote on Twitter.</p><p>“He is a great player and a 2014 premiership winner. I met him at Eastgardens in 2016, thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.”</p><p>Other NRL fans agree Turner was “taken too soon”.</p><p>One person wrote online: “Always a 2014 Rabbitoh premiership player, taken away too soon. Only the good die young.”</p><p>Another person said the news was “terrible”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“(He) was always one of the nicest and most welcoming guys at Souths, and someone you were genuinely happy to see win a premiership in 2014,” the social media user wrote.</p><p>“Thinking of all his family and friends, along with everyone at Souths and Coonabarabran.”</p><p><i>- with NCA NewsWire</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfo7%2Bte8KopqeZkpa%2Foq7RmqVmqpybsG68zqyrZqCVlr%2B1ssSlq2asop6vtsDEZquoZZyWwaZ5xaippp2iYre2usioqWajqaGybsDUq6Weql%2Bjsri%2FjKyrqKqpZLJzscNvmHBtaWuwdLHDmmhqaZSXs6WxkGlsbJyVaq55</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html&text=Rugby%20league%20news%202023%3a%20Coonabarabran%20post%20heartfelt%20tribute%20to%20late%20former%20junior%20and%20Premiership%20R&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html&title=Rugby%20league%20news%202023%3a%20Coonabarabran%20post%20heartfelt%20tribute%20to%20late%20former%20junior%20and%20Premiership%20R" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html&title=Rugby%20league%20news%202023%3a%20Coonabarabran%20post%20heartfelt%20tribute%20to%20late%20former%20junior%20and%20Premiership%20R" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html&title=Rugby%20league%20news%202023%3a%20Coonabarabran%20post%20heartfelt%20tribute%20to%20late%20former%20junior%20and%20Premiership%20R" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcoonabarabran-rlfc-post-heartfelt-tribute-to-late-former-junior-kyle-turner.html&description=Rugby%20league%20news%202023%3a%20Coonabarabran%20post%20heartfelt%20tribute%20to%20late%20former%20junior%20and%20Premiership%20R" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sammy-wilk-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sammy Wilk  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ralph-macchio-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ralph Macchio: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
