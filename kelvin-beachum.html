Head coach <a href=#>Todd Bowles</a> named Beachum the starting left tackle to begin the regular season. He started all 16 games for the Jets in 2017 and performed fairly well, receiving a 72.7 overall grade by Pro Football Focus. In comparison, the New York Jets former starting left tackle, <a href=#>Ryan Clady</a>, received an overall grade of 47.2 from Pro Football Focus in 2016.</p><p>In 2017, Beachum appeared on an episode of the HGTV program Fixer Upper, in which he helped his parents renovate a $130,000 new house by giving them an extra $100,000 for their renovation budget.</p><p>On March 9, 2016, Beachum became a free agent and was ranked by PFF as the second best free agent offensive tackle behind <a href=#>Cordy Glenn</a>. He met with multiple teams, including the New York Jets, Seattle Seahawks, and Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>On March 15, 2016, the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Beachum to a one-year, $5 million contract that includes a four-year, $40 million option with $1.5 million guaranteed.</p><p>He entered his first training camp with the Jaguars competing with <a href=#>Luke Joeckel</a> to be the starting left tackle. On August 30, 2016, head coach <a href=#>Gus Bradley</a> named him the starting left tackle to begin the regular season. Beachum made his first start for the Jacksonville Jaguars in their season-opening 27-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers. He suffered a concussion in a Week 2 matchup against the San Diego Chargers and was inactive for Week 3. He returned the following game and started the last 13 games of the regular season. Beachum finished his first season with the Jaguars starting in 15 games and was considered a disappointment after surrendering 49 quarterback pressures. The 49 quarterback pressures was the 11th most by any offensive tackles in 2016. He received a 44.3 PFF production grade that ranked him 63rd out of 78th offensive tackles that qualified.</p><p>Beachum entered his final year on his rookie contract in 2015 and started the regular season at left tackle. On October 18, 2015, he left during a 25-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals after tearing his left ACL. He was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Beachum entered the regular season in 2014 as the Pittsburgh Steeler's de facto starting left tackle. He finished his third season starting all 16 regular season games and was ranked the fifth best left tackle by Pro Football Focus. He also earned the fifth highest grade among tackles, finishing with a +21.7 overall grade from PFF and a 97.5 grade in pass blocking efficiency. Beachum finished third in pass blocking efficiency, behind only <a href=#>Andrew Whitworth</a> and Joe Thomas.</p><p>With the departure of <a href=#>Max Starks</a>, Beachum entered training camp competing for the vacant left tackle position with <a href=#>Marcus Gilbert</a> and <a href=#>Mike Adams</a>. He was named the backup to starting right tackle Gilbert and starting left tackle Adams to begin the regular season. He earned his first official start of the season in the Pittsburgh Steeler's season-opener, beginning the game as a tight end, during a 16-9 loss to the Tennessee Titans. During a Week 6 matchup against the Tennessee Titans, Beachum was named the starting left tackle in place of <a href=#>Mike Adams</a> and remained the starter for the remainder of the season. Beachum finished the 2013 season with 12 starts in 15 games and played 840 offensive snaps, earning an -0.4 grade from Pro Football Focus.</p><p>Coming out of college, Beachum was projected to by the majority of analysts to be selected in the seventh round or be a priority undrafted free agent. He was ranked as the 24th best offensive guard although he played tackle in college. Many analysts and scouts were conflicted on his position due to his height. Beachum was invited to the NFL Combine as an offensive tackle and was able to complete all the drills and positional workouts. On May 14, 2012, he participated at SMU's Pro Day and decided to only do the bench. Although he lacked size for an offensive tackle, scouts did compliment his lateral movement and quickness off the ball.</p><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Beachum in the seventh round (248th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft. He was the 20th and last offensive tackle taken and was the third offensive lineman drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the draft.</p><p>On May 10, 2012, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Beachum to a four-year, $2.14 million contract with a signing bonus of $49,816.</p><p>On September 23, 2012, Beachum made his professional regular season debut in a 34-31 loss to the Oakland Raiders.
