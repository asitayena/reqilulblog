His parents’ names are Mary Teresa (née Shields) and Herb Matthews. He has four brothers: Herb, James, Charles, and Bruce. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">James</a> is a Republican politician in Pennsylvania.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>He attended La Salle College High School. In 1967, he graduated from the College of the Holy Cross, which is situated in the state of Massachusetts’ city of Worcester. He also did graduate work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Apart from these, he also attended Harvard University as a visiting fellow in their Institute of Politics.</p><p class=align-left>Beyond Chris Matthews education, he holds tens of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">honorary degrees</a>, including the following:</p><ul><li>Doctor of Communication from St. Joseph’s University</li><li>Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Suffolk University</li><li>Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Rochester</li><li>Doctorates from College of the Holy Cross, Drexel University, Fordham University, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, La Salle University, Merrimack College, Peirce College</li><li>Doctorate of Humane Letters (DHL) from Quinnipiac University, Howard University, Old Dominion University, Temple University, and Washington University in St. Louis</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9a2c4d4700a69841.jpg><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Between 1968 and 1970, he served as a member of the United States Peace Corps as a trade development advisor in Swaziland. After this, Chris Matthews career as we know it today began.</p><h4><strong>In politics</strong></h4><p class=align-left>He worked as an officer of the U.S. Capitol Police in Washington, D.C. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tried but failed</a> in his run for Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p class=align-left>He worked as a speechwriter for former U.S. president Jimmy Carter.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Chris Long bio: stats, NFL career, Twitter, wife, podcast and net worth</p><h4><strong>In newspaper journalism</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Between 1987 and 2000, he worked for 13 years as the Washington, D.C. bureau chief for the San Francisco Examiner. He spent an additional 2 years as a nationally syndicated columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, bringing his total number of years in print journalism to 15.

It was a political show with politicians and political pundits as guests. Between 2002 and 2013, he hosted a separate but somewhat similar show, <i>The Chris Matthews Show</i> on NBC. This was a political roundtable with different journalists at the same time and Matthews acting as the moderator.</p><p class=align-left>He covered every major U.S. election and was expected to stay on the current one, with his retirement coming after it was concluded in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1e0148d28bd83d2e.jpg><h3>Controversies</h3><p class=align-left>Over recent years, there have been a number of negative stories emerging about him. In 2017, there were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">details about a settlement</a> from 1999 revolving around inappropriate comments he made about his female producer in front of their coworkers.</p><p class=align-left>In February, Laura Bassett, a political journalist, alleged that he had made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inappropriate comments</a> towards her in October 2016, allegedly asking:</p>Why haven’t I fallen in love with you yet? Keep putting makeup on her, I’ll fall in love with her.<p class=align-left>She claims this interaction happened before she went on the show to comment about the sexual harassment allegations against Donald Trump.</p><p class=align-left>Also, in February, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">came under fire</a> for comparing the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ win in the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses to Nazi Germany’s occupation of France in 1940 during World War 2. The comparison infuriated many since some members of Sanders’ family were killed by the Nazis in the holocaust. He later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">issued an apology</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9c064f9c000fb385.jpg><h3>Chris Matthews retirement</h3><p class=align-left>He was expected to retire in November 2020 after the presidential election was completed. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on March 2nd, 2020</a>, he announced he was leaving very abruptly while on air. He said the following:</p>I am retiring. This is the last Hardball on MSNBC … The younger generations ... are improving the workplace, we are talking here about better standards than we grew up with, fair standards. A lot of it has to do with how we talk to each other, compliments on a woman’s appearance that some men — including me — might have once incorrectly thought were okay were never okay. Not then and certainly not today...<p class=align-left>This statement was followed immediately with a commercial break and Chris Matthews retiring from the show with a different host in his place right after the break.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/57bbea0300d40603.jpg><h3>Family</h3><p class=align-left>Chris Matthews wife is the former reporter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kathleen Matthews</a> (née Cunningham) since 1980.
